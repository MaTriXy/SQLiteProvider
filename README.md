A simplification of database access for Android.


## Description

sqlite-provider implements a ContentProvider for you that allows database access using [Uri][1]s
The library is meant to augment the ContentProvider interface to fit SQLite in a more pronounced way. The aim is to set convention on queries via Uris.


## Adding to your project

To start using this library, add these lines to the `build.gradle` of your project:

```groovy
repositories {
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.novoda:sqlite-provider:2.0.0'
}
```

## Upgrading from < 1.0.4

Please note the name change from `sqliteprovider-core` to `sqlite-provider` when the version went beyond 1.0.4 (all the way back in 2014!). If you're upgrading from a version that old, don't forget to change the name too!
